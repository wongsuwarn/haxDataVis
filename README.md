# HPAX DataVis Bootcamp

This is the Github repo for the HPAX DataVis bootcamp taking place in Angel Square G3 on Tuesday May 29 and Wednesday May 30. 

The bootcamp will focus mainly on three data visualisation tools: [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) in Python and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/en-gb).

The bootcamp is intended as a 2-day workshop to share knowledge between HPAXers on data visualisation, with a view to having all bootcampers able to use whichever tool(s) of choice in the future to better explore and communicate insights from EG data.

2. Tableau server access (? -TBC)

### Installing required software

* For the Altair+Python workshop, a step by step software installation guide setup_instructions.ipynb is available in this repository. Please follow the guide make sure your computer can generate a basic Altair chart in [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) before the workshop. 

If you have any problems please message in the hcom-hpax-hax Slack channel (others are likely to run into the same problem), or let Jonny or I know.

From 9am-9.30am on Day 1, we will have a laptop setup surgery session for any last-minute problems.
